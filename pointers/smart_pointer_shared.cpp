shared_ptr:
By using shared_ptr more than one pointer can point to 
this one object at a time and itâ€™ll maintain a Reference 
Counter using the use_count() method.

C++ program to demonstrate the working of shared_ptr
Here both smart pointer P1 and P2 are pointing to the
object Adddition to which they both maintain a reference
of the object
