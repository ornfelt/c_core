	How to insert in an unsorted array:

	Insert at the end:
	In an unsorted array, the insert operation is faster as compared to a sorted array
	because we donâ€™t have to care about the position at which the element is to be placed.

	Time Complexity: O(1) 
	Auxiliary Space: O(1)

// n is current size of arr[]. This
// function returns n + 1 if insertion
