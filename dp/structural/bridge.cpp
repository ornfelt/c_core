/**
	Bridge is a structural design pattern that divides business logic or huge class into
	separate class hierarchies that can be developed independently.

	One of these hierarchies (often called the Abstraction) will get a reference to an
	object of the second hierarchy (Implementation). The abstraction will be able to
	delegate some (sometimes, most) of its calls to the implementations object. Since all
	implementations will have a common interface, theyâ€™d be interchangeable inside the
	abstraction.

	Usage examples: The Bridge pattern is especially useful when dealing with
	cross-platform apps, supporting multiple types of database servers or working with
	several API providers of a certain kind (for example, cloud platforms, social
	networks, etc.)

	Identification: Bridge can be recognized by a clear distinction between some
	controlling entity and several different platforms that it relies on.
