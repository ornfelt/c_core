/*
	Conceptual Example:
	The Builder pattern is used when the desired product is complex and requires multiple
	steps to complete. In this case, several construction methods would be simpler than a
	single monstrous constructor. The potential problem with the multistage building
	process is that a partially built and unstable product may be exposed to the client.
	The Builder pattern keeps the product private until itâ€™s fully built.

	In the below code, we see different types of houses (igloo and normalHouse) being
	constructed by iglooBuilder and normalBuilder. Each house type has the same
	construction steps. The optional director struct helps to organize the building
	process.
*/

func main() {
    normalBuilder := getBuilder("normal")
    iglooBuilder := getBuilder("igloo")

    director := newDirector(normalBuilder)
    normalHouse := director.buildHouse()

    fmt.Printf("Normal House Door Type: %s\n", normalHouse.doorType)
    fmt.Printf("Normal House Window Type: %s\n", normalHouse.windowType)
    fmt.Printf("Normal House Num Floor: %d\n", normalHouse.floor)

    director.setBuilder(iglooBuilder)
    iglooHouse := director.buildHouse()

    fmt.Printf("\nIgloo House Door Type: %s\n", iglooHouse.doorType)
    fmt.Printf("Igloo House Window Type: %s\n", iglooHouse.windowType)
    fmt.Printf("Igloo House Num Floor: %d\n", iglooHouse.floor)
