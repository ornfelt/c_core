/**
	Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to defines a skeleton
	of an algorithm in a base class and let subclasses override the steps without changing
	the overall algorithmâ€™s structure.

	Usage examples: The Template Method pattern is quite common in C++ frameworks.
	Developers often use it to provide framework users with a simple means of extending
	standard functionality using inheritance.

	Identification: Template Method can be recognized if you see a method in base class
	that calls a bunch of other methods that are either abstract or empty
