/**
	Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that turns a set of behaviors into objects and
	makes them interchangeable inside original context object.

	The original object, called context, holds a reference to a strategy object. The
	context delegates executing the behavior to the linked strategy object. In order to
	change the way the context performs its work, other objects may replace the currently
	linked strategy object with another one.

	Usage examples: The Strategy pattern is very common in C++ code. Itâ€™s often used in
	various frameworks to provide users a way to change the behavior of a class without
	extending it.

	Identification: Strategy pattern can be recognized by a method that lets a nested
	object do the actual work, as well as a setter that allows replacing that object with
	a different one.
