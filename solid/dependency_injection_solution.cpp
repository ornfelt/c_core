The usefulness of Dependency Injection is in that the implementation of a class is more
flexible and independent by decreasing the amount of coupling between a client and another
service. The exact decoupling is the removal of a client classâ€™s dependency on the
implementation of an interface, instead requiring the implementation to be passed in.

The solution for this issue is Dependency Injection. We can inject the implementation for
GasolineSource at runtime and use runtime polymorphism to abstract away the explicit
implementation of GasolineSource.
